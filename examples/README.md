# Creating Login, Password, and Database 1Password Items

This example demonstrates creating the currently supported types of 1Password Items (Logins, Passwords, and Databases).
## Prerequisites

The 1Password Terraform provider supports using both [1Password Connect Server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-connect-server)
and [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli).

You must install [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli) on the machine running Terraform to use it. Refer to the
[Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/install-software#only-install-standalone-binaries) to learn how to install 1Password CLI on Terraform Cloud.

## Use with 1Password CLI

Minimum 1Password CLI version `v2.23.0` is required.

Retry mechanism is implemented when using the provider with 1Password CLI. The reason for having a retry mechanism is that 1Password doesn't allow parallel modification on the items located in the same vault.
Note that each retry fast forwards to the [service account rate limit](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/rate-limits/) if use with service account.

It's recommended to limit the number of parallel resource operations. It can be done by using `-parallelism=n` flag when running `terraform apply`, where `n` is the number of parallel resource operations (the default is `10`).
```
terraform apply `-parallelism=n`
```

### Authenticate CLI with service account

To authenticate CLI with service account:
1. [Create a service account](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started#create-a-service-account)
2. Set `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable or `service_account_token` in the provider configuration.

### Authenticate the CLI with user account using biometric unlock

To authenticate the CLI with user account using biometric unlock:
1. [Turn on the app integration](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/app-integration/#step-1-turn-on-the-app-integration)
2. In the terminal run `op account ls` to find sign-in address or account ID. It will print similar output in the console:
```
URL                        EMAIL                                         USER ID
acme.dev.com               test.user@acme.com                            HERE_WILL_BE_REAL_USER_ID
acme.prod.com              prod.user@acme.com                            HERE_WILL_BE_REAL_USER_ID
```
3. Set `OP_ACCOUNT` environment variable or `account` in the provider configuration with the `URL` or `USER ID` value from the previous step.
4. When the biometric unlock popup appears while running terraform command, [authenticate it using fingerprint or password](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/app-integration/#step-2-enter-any-command-to-sign-in).

## Use with 1Password Connect

To use the provider with 1Password Connect you need to
1. [Deploy your Connect server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect/get-started#deployment)
2. Set `OP_CONNECT_HOST` environment variable or `url` in the provider configuration.
3. Set `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` environment variable or `token` in the provider configuration.

## Create the Items

From the `examples/directory` run:

```sh
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding 1password/onepassword versions matching "~> 1.0.0"...
- Installing 1password/onepassword v1.0.0...
- Installed 1password/onepassword v1.0.0 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 6681876AE08DC4BF)

Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

$ terraform apply


An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # onepassword_item.demo_db will be created
  + resource "onepassword_item" "demo_db" {
      + category = "database"
      + database = "Example MySQL Instance"
      + hostname = "localhost"
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + password = (sensitive value)
      + port     = "3306"
      + title    = "Demo TF Database"
      + type     = "mysql"
      + username = "root"
      + uuid     = (known after apply)
      + vault    = "<TF_VAR_demo_vault>"
    }

  # onepassword_item.demo_login will be created
  + resource "onepassword_item" "demo_login" {
      + category = "login"
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + password = (sensitive value)
      + title    = "Demo Terraform Login"
      + username = "test@example.com"
      + uuid     = (known after apply)
      + vault    = "<TF_VAR_demo_vault>"
    }

  # onepassword_item.demo_password will be created
  + resource "onepassword_item" "demo_password" {
      + category = "password"
      + id       = (known after apply)
      + password = (sensitive value)
      + title    = "Demo Password Recipe"
      + uuid     = (known after apply)
      + vault    = "<TF_VAR_demo_vault>"

      + password_recipe {
          + digits  = true
          + length  = 40
          + letters = true
          + symbols = false
        }
    }

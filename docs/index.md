# 1Password Connect Terraform Provider

Use the 1Password Connect Terraform Provider to reference, create, or update items in your existing vaults using [1Password Secrets Automation](https://1password.com/secrets).

## Using a Service Account Token

The 1Password Connect Terraform Provider supports both the [1Password Connect Server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-connect-server)
and [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-service-accounts). To use a service account token, the
[1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli) has to be installed on the machine running terraform. For how to do this in terraform cloud, see
[here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/install-software#only-install-standalone-binaries).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "onepassword" {
  url = "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

# 1Password Terraform Provider

Use the 1Password Terraform Provider to reference, create, or update items in your existing vaults using [1Password Secrets Automation](https://1password.com/secrets).

The 1Password Terraform Provider supports both the [1Password Connect Server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-connect-server)
and [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-service-accounts). To use a service account token, the
[1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli) has to be installed on the machine running terraform. For how to do this in terraform cloud, see
[here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/install-software#only-install-standalone-binaries).

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "onepassword" {
  url                   = "http://localhost:8080"
  token                 = "CONNECT_TOKEN"
  service_account_token = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
  op_cli_path           = "OP_CLI_PATH"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `op_cli_path` (String) The path to the 1Password CLI binary. Can also be sourced from OP_CLI_PATH. Defaults to `op`. Only used when setting a `service_account_token`.
- `service_account_token` (String) A valid token for your 1Password Service Account. Can also be sourced from OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN. Either this or `token` must be set.
- `token` (String) A valid token for your 1Password Connect API. Can also be sourced from OP_CONNECT_TOKEN. Either this or `service_account_token` must be set.
- `url` (String) The HTTP(S) URL where your 1Password Connect API can be found. Must be provided through the OP_CONNECT_HOST environment variable if this attribute is not set. Can be omitted, if service_account_token is set.

## Known Service Accounts limitation:
Users may encounter the following error `op error: (409) Conflict: Internal server conflict` when create/update/delete a bunch of items in the same vault as Terraform Provider handles each resource separately and therefore it makes a bunch of parallel requests using CLI for each of the resources.

There are ways to avoid this:
1. Use `depends_on` in your resource definition to make sure the Provider makes requests sequentially.
2. After it fails with `409` error run `terraform apply` again till all the changes will be applied.
3. Use Connect.
4. Put items in the different vaults.

This will be addressed in the next release.

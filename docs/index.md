# 1Password Terraform provider

Use the 1Password Terraform provider to reference, create, or update items in your existing vaults using [1Password Secrets Automation](https://1password.com/secrets).

The 1Password Terraform provider supports using both [1Password Connect Server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-connect-server)
and [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-service-accounts).
To use a service account token, you must install [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli) on the machine running Terraform. Refer to the
[Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/install-software#only-install-standalone-binaries) to learn how to install 1Password CLI on Terraform Cloud.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "onepassword" {
  url                   = "http://localhost:8080"
  token                 = "CONNECT_TOKEN"
  service_account_token = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN"
  op_cli_path           = "OP_CLI_PATH"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `op_cli_path` (String) The path to the 1Password CLI binary. Can also be sourced from OP_CLI_PATH. Defaults to `op`. Only used when setting a `service_account_token`.
- `service_account_token` (String) A valid token for your 1Password Service Account. Can also be sourced from OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN. Either this or `token` must be set.
- `token` (String) A valid token for your 1Password Connect API. Can also be sourced from OP_CONNECT_TOKEN. Either this or `service_account_token` must be set.
- `url` (String) The HTTP(S) URL where your 1Password Connect API can be found. Must be provided through the OP_CONNECT_HOST environment variable if this attribute is not set. Can be omitted, if service_account_token is set.

## Use with service accounts:
Retry mechanism is implemented when using provider with service accounts. Each retry fast forwards to the [service account rate limit](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/rate-limits/).

It's recommended to limit the number of parallel resource operations. It can be done by using `-parallelism=n` flag when do `terraform apply`, where `n` is the number of parallel resource operations that defaults to `10`.
```
terraform apply `-parallelism=n`
```

The reason of having retry mechanism is that 1Password doesn't allow parallel modification on the items located in the same vault.

# 1Password Connect Terraform Provider

Use the 1Password Connect Terraform Provider to reference, create, or update items in your 1Password Vaults.

## Usage

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    onepassword = {
      source = "1Password/onepassword"
      version = "~> 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "onepassword" {
  url = "http://localhost:8080"
}

variable "vault_id" {}

resource "onepassword_item" "demo_login" {
  vault = var.vault_id

  title    = "Demo Terraform Login"
  category = "password"

  username = "demo-username"

  password_recipe {
    length  = 40
    symbols = false
  }
}
```

See the [examples](./examples/) directory for a full example.

## Building

To build the 1Password Connect Terraform provider run the following

```sh
$ go build .
```

This will create the `terraform-provider-onepassword` binary

## Testing the Provider

To run the go tests and check test coverage run the following

```sh
$ go test -v ./... -cover
```

## Generating Documentation

Documentation is generated for the provider using the [terraform documentation plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs). This plugin uses the schema `Description` field in conjunction with the contents of the `/templates` and `/examples` folders to generate the `/docs` content.

To regenerate the `/docs` markdown run

```sh
$ go generate
```

## Installing Locally

To install the binary it must be copied to the appropriate terraform plugin directory. You may need to create the appropriate directories. For more information [see these Terraform 0.13 plugin docs](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/automatic-installation-of-third-party-providers-with-terraform-0-13)

The current version of the provider is considered to be 0.2 and `darwin_amd64` should match your machines operating system and architecture in the format `$OS_$ARCH`. For example macOS is `darwin_amd64` and linux is `linux_amd64`.

```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/github.com/1Password/onepassword/0.2/darwin_amd64/
$ cp ./terraform-provider-onepassword ~/.terraform.d/plugins/github.com/1Password/onepassword/0.2/darwin_amd64/terraform-provider-onepassword
```

## Using plugin locally

In your Terraform configuration you will need to specify the op plugin with

```tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    onepassword = {
      source   = "github.com/1Password/onepassword"
      version = "~> 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "onepassword" {
  url     = "http://<1Password Connect API Hostname>"
}
```

After copying a newly built version of the provider to the plugins directory you will have to run `terraform init` again. If you forget to do this terraform will error out and tell you to do so.

# 1Password Terraform provider

Use the 1Password Terraform provider to reference, create, or update items in your existing vaults using [1Password Secrets Automation](https://1password.com/secrets).

## Authentication

The 1Password Terraform provider supports multiple authentication methods:

### Authenticate with Service Account

1. [Create a service account](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started#create-a-service-account)
2. Set `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable or `service_account_token` in the provider configuration.

### Authenticate with Biometric Unlock

1. [Turn on the app integration](https://developer.1password.com/docs/sdks/desktop-app-integrations/)
2. Get the name of your account as it appears at the top of the left sidebar in the 1Password desktop app. Alternatively, in the terminal run `op account get` to find the account ID.
3. Set `OP_ACCOUNT` environment variable or `account` in the provider configuration with the `NAME` or `ID` value from the previous step.
4. When the biometric unlock popup appears while running terraform command, [authenticate it using fingerprint or password](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/app-integration/#step-2-enter-any-command-to-sign-in).

### Authenticate with Connect Credentials

1. [Deploy your Connect server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect/get-started#deployment)
2. Set `OP_CONNECT_HOST` environment variable or `url` in the provider configuration.
3. Set `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` environment variable or `token` in the provider configuration.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

You can set each of the configuration options using environment variables.
Environment variables are a more secure way to set configuration options because they prevent accidentally pushing sensitive values to the project repo.

- `OP_CONNECT_HOST` - The URL where your 1Password Connect API can be found.
- `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` - A valid token for your 1Password Connect API.
- `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` - A valid 1Password service account token to use with 1Password SDK
- `OP_ACCOUNT` - A valid account's sign-in address or ID to use with 1Password SDK and biometrics unlock.

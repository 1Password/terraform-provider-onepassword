# 1Password Terraform provider

Use the 1Password Terraform provider to reference, create, or update items in your existing vaults using [1Password Secrets Automation](https://1password.com/secrets).

The 1Password Terraform provider supports using both [1Password Connect Server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-connect-server)
and [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-service-accounts).
To use a service account token, you must install [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli) on the machine running Terraform. Refer to the
[Terraform documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/install-software#only-install-standalone-binaries) to learn how to install 1Password CLI on Terraform Cloud.

## Example Usage

## Known Service Accounts limitation:
Users might encounter the following error if they create, update, or delete too many items simultaneously in the same 1Password vault.

\```
op error: (409) Conflict: Internal server conflict
\```

The 1Password Terraform provider handles each resource separately. As a result, each request to perform a create, update, or delete operation using CLI to create an additional parallel request. Too many parallel requests might result in one or more race conditions.

You can avoid receiving the 409 error in one of the following ways:
1. Use `depends_on` in your resource definition to make sure the provider makes requests sequentially.
2. After receiving the `409` error, run `terraform apply` again. You might need to run this multiple times until it applies all the changes.
3. Use a Connect server.
4. Put items in the different vaults.

This will be addressed in the next release.

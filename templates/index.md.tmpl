# 1Password Terraform Provider

Use the 1Password Terraform Provider to reference, create, or update items in your existing vaults using [1Password Secrets Automation](https://1password.com/secrets).

The 1Password Terraform Provider supports both the [1Password Connect Server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-connect-server)
and [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-service-accounts). To use a service account token, the
[1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli) has to be installed on the machine running terraform. For how to do this in terraform cloud, see
[here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/run/install-software#only-install-standalone-binaries).

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Known Service Accounts limitation:
Users may encounter the following error `op error: (409) Conflict: Internal server conflict` when create/update/delete a bunch of items in the same vault as Terraform Provider handles each resource separately and therefore it makes a bunch of parallel requests using CLI for each of the resources.

There are ways to avoid this:
1. Use `depends_on` in your resource definition to make sure the Provider makes requests sequentially.
2. After it fails with `409` error run `terraform apply` again till all the changes will be applied.
3. Use Connect.
4. Put items in the different vaults.

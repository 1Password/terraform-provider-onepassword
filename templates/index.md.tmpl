# 1Password Terraform provider

Use the 1Password Terraform provider to reference, create, or update items in your existing vaults using [1Password Secrets Automation](https://1password.com/secrets).

The 1Password Terraform provider supports using both [1Password Connect Server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/secrets-automation/#1password-connect-server)
and [1Password SDK](https://developer.1password.com/docs/sdks/).

## Use with 1Password Connect

To use the provider with 1Password Connect you need to
1. [Deploy your Connect server](https://developer.1password.com/docs/connect/get-started#deployment)
2. Set `OP_CONNECT_HOST` environment variable or `url` in the provider configuration.
3. Set `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` environment variable or `token` in the provider configuration.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf"}}

You can set each of the configuration options using environment variables.
Environment variables are a more secure way to set configuration options because they prevent accidentally pushing sensitive values to the project repo.

- `OP_CONNECT_HOST` - The URL where your 1Password Connect API can be found.
- `OP_CONNECT_TOKEN` - A valid token for your 1Password Connect API.
- `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` - A valid 1Password service account token to use with 1Password SDK
- `OP_ACCOUNT` - A valid account name or ID to use with 1Password SDK and biometrics unlock.
